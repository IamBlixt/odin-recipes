    <h1>Beef</h1>
    <img src="beef.jpg" height="500" alt="Tasty beef">

    <ul>
        <li>2kg topside of beef (buy one with a layer of natural fat on the top)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil or sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp English mustard powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp Maldon sea salt</li>
        <li>2 large carrots , halved lengthways</li>
        <li>12 banana shallots , peeled and halved lengthways</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>300ml full-bodied red wine ( I used a shiraz blend)</li>
        <li>500ml fresh beef stock</li>
        <li>2 tsp redcurrant jelly</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>

        <li>
            Let the meat come to room temperature for 1 hr before you roast it. Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Dry the meat with
            kitchen paper, then rub the oil all over it. Mix the mustard powder with the sea salt and 1 tsp pepper, then rub this
            over the meat too. Lay the carrots in a large roasting tin to make a trivet and sit the beef on top, fat-side up.
        </li>

        <li>
            Roast for 15 mins, then turn the heat down to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and roast for another 55 mins. This will give you
            medium beef; for medium-rare, cook for 45 mins. (When itâ€™s done, a probe thermometer inserted into the thickest part of
            the beef should read 65C).
        </li>

        <li>
            With 30 mins cooking time left, baste the beef in the fat that has pooled in the tin, add the shallots and bay leaves,
            and coat these in the fat too. Season and return to the oven. Meanwhile, boil the wine in a small saucepan to reduce it
            by two-thirds.
        </li>
  
        <li>
            When the meat is ready, transfer to a board, cover loosely with foil and leave to rest. Turn the oven up to 200C/180C
            fan/gas 6 and return the tin to the oven for a further 10-15 mins until the shallots are tender.
        </li>

        <li>
            Scoop out the shallots with a slotted spoon and set aside to keep warm. Remove the excess fat from the tin and discard,
            leaving 1 tbsp fat and all the dark juices behind. Add the flour and cook on the hob for 2 mins, stirring constantly.
            Gradually whisk in the reduced wine, followed by the stock and redcurrant jelly, scraping up all the tasty bits from the
            bottom of the tin. Bubble until thickened and rich, add the juices from the resting meat, then season to taste. Discard
            the carrots. Serve the beef with the gravy and shallots.
        </li>
    </ol>
